# Niabridge

An Angular app that visualize bridges in Ontario. This application allows the user to go through the datasets visually and interact with it. Basic CSS was used for the UI/UX Desing, and for the map itseelf, made use of a powerful library known as Leaflet.js. The dataset was collected from the Ontario Government website.

Currently done with most of th stuffs. Will be adding more options. will make it a full working web app and release it.
